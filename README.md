# Blackjack_Python

A Python implementation of the classic Blackjack card game.

## Concept

Blackjack is a popular casino banking game played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. Numbered cards are worth their face value, while face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more beneficial to the player.


# Running the Game
You have two options:

## Option 1: Run the game from the command line
### Installation

To run the game locally, you'll need to set up a Python environment. Here's how:

**Install Python**: Install Python 3.9 or later from the official website if you haven't already.

**Create Virtual Environment**: Create a new virtual environment using `python -m venv blackjack-env` (replace "blackjack-env" with your preferred name).

**Activate Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment by running `source blackjack-env/bin/activate` on Linux/Mac or `blackjack-env\Scripts\activate` on Windows.

**Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Clone Repository**: Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

**Run Game**: Run the game using `python main.py`.
